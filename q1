Consider the following Java class.

public class Wizard{

  Spell[] spells;
  Potion[] potions;
  String name;
  int points=0;
  
  public Wizard(String name){
    this.name = name;}
    
}

A.  Write a method for the Wizard class named "powerUp" that adds 10 to the field "points".

public static void powerup(){
        points = points + 10;
    }

B.  Write a method "cast" that casts the n-th element of the "spells" array.  

public Spell cast(int N){
      return spells[N];
    }

    Include an interface (seperately) for the Spell class to insure your "cast" method will interact with the class.
    
       public interface SpellMaster {
        public Spell cast();
    }
    
C.  Write a "hello" method that prints an introduction stating the name of the Wizard.
 public static void hello(){
        System.out.println("I am the wizard" + this.name + ".");
    }
D.  Write a main method for the Wizard class.  In it construct a wizard with name "Harry Poppins".  Use the hello() method.

public static void main(String[] args){
        Wizard MyWizard = new Wizard("Harry Poppins");
        MyWizard.hello();
    }
