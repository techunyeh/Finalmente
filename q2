A.  Explain what recursion is and when it is useful.

    Recursion is the function that it calls itself to keep computing a variable, it is useful to save lines, especially
    in mathematical sequences.

    Explain what the |termination step| and |recursion step| are in a recursive method.
    
    Termination step: the first step of the loop when the recursion stops.
    
    
B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.

The last object added in a Stack will be dealt with first(LIFO), whereas the first object added of a queue
will be the first to deal with(FIFO).

C.  Write a class for an element of a doublely-linked list.

public class DLnkList{
  private DLnk head = new DLnk();
    public int length = 0;
    
    public DLnkList(){}
        public void addDLnk(DLnk newlink){
            newlink.setNext(this.head);
            this.head.setPrev(newlink);
            this.head=newlink;
            length=length + 1;}
                
    public DLnk getiLnk(int i){
        DLnk it = this.head;
        while(i>0){
        it=it.getNext();
        i=i-1;}
        return it;}
                  
    public void removeHead(){
        this.head=this.head.getNext();
        this.head.setPrev(null);
        length = length -1;}
                  
    public DLnk getHead(){
        return this.head;}
                   
}

D.  Explain what a Merkle Tree is.  
    
    Merkle tree is a kind of binary tree which merges tons of hash codes into one hash.
    
    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
    
    The structure is just like a binary tree. But in a merkle tree every node it based upon the one coming after it. 
    It is build from down to up. Its prupose is to hold many informations which are needed to verify a document.
    
    What is the Merkle root?
    
    Merkle root is the element at the top of the tree.
    
    What is the function of a certificate in this data structure?
    
    It will return the root and any node it needed to veryify a given document which was used to build the tree.
